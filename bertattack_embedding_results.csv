Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He [[said]] \""""Should be ready in a few days\"""". So I come in a few [[jours]] later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am [[wage]] for the labor of [[recording]] out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look [[in]] the [[billings]] and can't see a [[well]] breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \""""duke it over\"""" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that [[financial]] my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?",0.027132093906402588,0.5052746534347534,0,1,0,638,"Successful"

"When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. [[None]] [[of]] the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time.

It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people [[likes]] about it. You can [[comte]] on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to [[affords]] the same [[addresses]] you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside.

"[[Despite]] [[living]] in PIttsburgh for [[most]] [[of]] my life, I've somehow managed to never [[eat]] [[at]] Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the [[restaurant]] was [[positive]] - the [[place]] had an [[old]] neighborhood feel [[to]] it, a [[small]] crowd [[was]] drinking [[at]] the [[end]] of the [[antique]] [[hardwood]] bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold [[German]] lager with a stout head [[of]] [[foam]].  I thought [[about]] how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I [[grabbed]] a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first [[taste]] [[of]] my beer.\n\nAnd I [[waited]]...[[and]] waited...[[and]] [[waited]] some [[more]] - [[for]] over 15 minutes [[before]] [[someone]] came [[around]] to take the [[order]].

[[Neither]] one [[greeted]] me [[or]] asked me what I [[would]] [[have]] [[like]] [[to]] [[order]].

The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).

My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""""bacon\"""" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""""meat\"""".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.

It [[were]] [[hideous]]. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with [[una]] meager slice [[to]] [[cheddar]] on [[chop]] [[Italy]] bread [[played]] signature Primanti-style: with [[lettuce]], [[onion]], [[und]] fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: [[horrendous]] [[odor]] ([[felt]] and [[eaten]] like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily [[opposition]] [[aux]] as long as it's not involved in [[somethin]] I'm trying to [[coma]]) with a gross, processed meat texture. [[Second]], the fries [[comfortably]] overwhelmed the sandwich, with their [[antique]] fryer grease [[tasting]]. [[Besides]], the sandwich was [[cumbersome]] and threatening to [[fell]] apart [[during]] [[each]] turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting [[spaghetti]], but this [[shortage]] of [[structures]] integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy [[meals]] partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. [[Comfortably]] the best [[party]] [[du]] the [[dietary]] [[were]] the Smallman [[Rue]] [[Frites]], [[und]] those [[was]] [[alike]] lack-luster. The \""""[[lard]]\"""" was simply bacon bits ([[ah]], the [[humanitarian]]!), the [[chilli]] [[became]] [[unimaginative]], and the cheese [[gravy]] [[und]] [[soured]] cream [[got]] [[kiddo]] [[albeit]] soggy the [[frites]]. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I [[willingness]] immediately disregard the culinary opinions of [[someone]] [[whom]] [[thought]] Primanti Bros. [[generated]] [[dignified]] [[alimentary]].",0.0004945993423461914,0.3996731638908386,0,0,0,836,"Failed"
"When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, [[but]] they did [[a]] pretty damn [[good]] [[job]]. Maybe not the [[best]] sandwich I've ever had in my life, [[but]] if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would [[definitely]] be [[five]] [[stars]] without a second thought.\n\nThe chili cheese fries were among the [[best]] I've ever had. I don't know what they do to them - it's not the chili that's particularly great, it's not the cheese that's particularly great, and it's not the fries that are particularly great. [[But]] somehow, putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable [[awesome]].\n\nThe sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good [[despite]] the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like [[seasoned]] lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, [[but]] just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really [[well]] on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location.","When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, [[though]] they did [[una]] pretty damn [[well]] [[labor]].
