[[Onto]] their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was [[charg–µd]] $[[20]] for a [[tuning]] up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can [[comprehend]] would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have [[cosùöù]] approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB [[before]] to the nice weather hitting [[Cincinnati]] in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out [[li]] don't [[’∞ear]] from these guys. A week goes by ...two [[week—ï]]...I think that's [[alrighty]] I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a [[stroll]]. Then I wind up [[gonna]] out of town for a [[weekly]] thinking for sure I'll get a [[calling]] from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So [[ich]] [[invitation]]. Turns out a [[bolts]] snapped when the [[machinist]] was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He [[say—ï]] \""""[[Would]] be ready in a few days\"""". So I come in a few days [[afterward]] to this mammoth [[bil‚Öº]]. I [[asùíå]] if I am [[pa—Éing]] for the [[jobs]] of taping out the screw? [[li]] don't [[thnk]] I [[forever]] got a straight [[respond]]? I [[gaze]] at the bill and can't [[behold]] a [[god]] breakdown of the [[char]] [[ges]]. Normally I would \""""duke it over\"""" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?",0.0026979446411132812,0.5075363516807556,0,1,0,709,"Successful"

For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks, so I had him do it because it wasn't an [[eÔΩçergency]] and I'd rather give him my business.

"When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. [[None]] of the eight dishes [[disappointed]]! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely [[loved]] the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to [[perfection]]. The [[walleye's]] skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time.

"Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She [[simmered]] her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No!
